### Description

ArbPasser is a groundbreaking tool in the blockchain space, designed as part of the Blockchain at Berkeley Fall 2023 consulting project with Arbitrum. This innovative application provides an alternative method for users to interact with Arbitrum through execution on a Layer 1 network like Ethereum. By enabling users to execute and sign their transactions with their MetaMask wallet while remaining on the Ethereum network, ArbPasser offers a unique approach to blockchain interactions.

In the blockchain domain, network reliability and trust in nodes are significant concerns. Issues like censorship by an RPC node or sequencer downtime can inhibit transactions during bridging or switching between chain-specific applications. ArbPasser addresses these challenges by:

- **Transaction Inclusion**: Allowing users to send their presigned Layer 2 (L2) transactions to a contract on Ethereum, which then bridges these transactions to a delayed inbox on Arbitrum One.
- **Transaction Submission**: Providing users with the option to force include their transaction, thus bypassing potential barriers.
